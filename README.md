# COMP-478-Project
Medical image analysis has become a crucial aspect of diagnosing and treating various diseases, such as brain tumors. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a widely used non-invasive technique that produces detailed brain images, making it a valuable tool for tumor detection. In recent years, deep learning methods have shown promising results in medical image analysis, including brain tumor classification. 

This project aims to explore the effectiveness of four popular pre-trained deep learning models, namely VGG-19, ResNet50, InceptionV3 Network, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet201, in brain tumor classification using the Brain Tumor MRI Images dataset. We fine-tune these models on the dataset and evaluate their performance using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The experimental results show that all five models achieve high accuracy, with VGG-19 achieving the highest accuracy of 92%. These findings demonstrate the potential of deep learning models, including VGG-19, ResNet50, InceptionV3 Network, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet201, in improving the accuracy and efficiency of medical image analysis for brain tumor classification.
